      text: The opponent has picked Dazzle and Axe so far, what would you suggest our team to pick against them?
    - user: Lenard
      text: Axe has a great capability of tanking melee damages so one option could be picking Drow Ranger as a carry to provide solid range attack. And for the support side Mirana can lock down him from afar.

      text: Would it work if I would play Phantom Lancer against Axe?
    - user: Lenard
      text: Absolutely not, Phantom Lancer tend to use too many illusions when fighting thanks to his Juxtapose skill, which will end up triggering Axe's Counter Helix skill a lot more than usual.
